# Banana Jack and BNC Adapters for RIGOL DL3000 Electronic Loads

## Overview

This project is about banana jack and BNC adapters for RIGOL's DL3000 series
electronic loads. There are already adapters for narrower binding posts (like
BK Precision, ...) but I did not find any for the 39 mm pitch of the RIGOL
DL3000 series.

These adapters are meant for conveniently feeding a few amperes - not for high
current applications.

## Variants and Bills of Material

### BNC Adapter

The BNC adapter has a pretty standard footprint. So you should be able to find
a suitable replacement from your preferred distributor. Information on
replacement parts welcome.

### Banana Jack Adapters

There are two board variants for sourcing the connectors from different
distributors.
